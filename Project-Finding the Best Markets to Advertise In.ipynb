    "We can try to search existing data that might be relevant for our purpose. One good candidate is the data from [freeCodeCamp's 2017 New Coder Survey](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/we-asked-20-000-people-who-they-are-and-how-theyre-learning-to-code-fff5d668969/). freeCodeCamp is a free e-learning platform that offers courses on web development. Because they run [a popular Medium publication](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/) (over 400,000 followers), their survey attracted new coders with varying interests (not only web development), which is ideal for the purpose of our analysis.\n",

We'd like to know:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Where are these new coders located.\n",

    "* How much money new coders are willing to spend on learning.\n",

    "Now that we found out that the sample has the right categories of people for our purpose, we can begin analyzing it. We can start with finding out where these new coders are located, and what are the densities (how many coderes there are) for each location.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data set provides information about the location of each participant at a country level. The `CountryCitizen` variable describes the country of origin for each participant, and the `CountryLive` variable describes what country each participants lives in (which may be different than the origin country).\n",
    "\n",
    "For our analysis, we'll work with the `CountryLive` variable because we're interested where people actually live at the moment when we run the ads. In other words, we're interested where people are located, not where they were born.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the data set provides information at a country level, we can think of each country as an individual market. This means we can frame our goal as finding the two best countries to advertise in.\n",
    "\n",
    "One indicator of a good market is the number of potential customers â€” the more potential customers in a market, the better. If our ads manage to convince 10% of the 5,000 potential customers in market A to buy our product, then this is better than convincing 100% of the 30 potential customers in market B."

    "Previously, we found useful information about the location of new coders, and what are the countries where new coders live, but we need to go more in depth with our analysis before taking a decision. We can continue by figuring out how much money new coders are actually willing to spend on learning. Advertising within markets where most people are only willing to learn for free is extremely unlikely to be profitable for us.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `MoneyForLearning` column describes in American dollars the amount of money spent by participants from the moment they started coding until the moment they completed the survey. Our company sells subscriptions at a price of $59 per month, and for this reason we're interested in finding out how much money each student spends per month.\n",
    "\n",
    "It also seems like a good idea to narrow down our analysis to only four countries: the US, India, the United Kingdom, and Canada. Two reasons for this decision are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* These are the countries having the highest absolute frequencies in our sample, which means we have a decent amount of data for each.\n",
    "* Our courses are written in English, and English is an official language in all these four countries. The more people that know English, the better our chances to target the right people with our ads."

[freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) is a free e-learning platform that offers courses on web development. Because they run [a popular Medium publication](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/) (over 400,000 followers), their survey attracted new coders with varying interests (not only web development), which is ideal for the purpose of our analysis.\n",

Below, we'll do a quick exploration of the `2017-fCC-New-Coders-Survey-Data.csv` file stored in the `clean-data` folder of the repository we just mentioned. We'll read in the file using the direct link [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/freeCodeCamp/2017-new-coder-survey/master/clean-data/2017-fCC-New-Coders-Survey-Data.csv)."

The `JobRoleInterest` column describes for every participant the role(s) they'd be interested in working in. If a participant is interested in working in a certain domain, it means that they're also interested in learning about that domain. So let's take a look at the frequency distribution table of this column [^1] and determine whether the data we have is relevant.\n",

    "    - 65% for the US, and 35% for Canada; etc.\n",

    "At this point, it's probably best to send our analysis to the marketing team and let them use their domain knowledge to decide. They might want to do some extra surveys in India and Canada and then get back to us for analyzing the new survey data.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this project, we analyzed survey data from new coders to find the best two markets to advertise in. The only solid conclusion we reached is that the US would be a good market to advertise in.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the second best market, it wasn't clear-cut what to choose between India and Canada. We decided to send the results to the marketing team so they can use their domain knowledge to take the best decision.\n",
